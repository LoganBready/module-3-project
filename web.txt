Question 1: How does the internet work?
The internet is a series of networks, or computers, that speak to eachother. These
computers/networks transmit data to eachother in packets.


Question 2: What happens when  you click on a link?
in the link you click, there will be a URL associated with it.  Your browser then uses
DNS to get the IP address of that URL.  Your browser will open a TCP connection and
connects with the HTTP/S server.  Your browser will then render the HTML of that server.
